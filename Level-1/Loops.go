/*
	What is the purpose of range ?
		To iterate over all the elements of a data structure, array, slice and others.
	What the difference between the line for index, element := range a and the line for _, element := range a ?
		index holds the position of the element in the data structure. Sometimes you may not need it, then you can use underscore.
		underscore is blank identifier check input.go file.
